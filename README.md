# Image Compression based on Non-Parametric Sampling in Noisy Environments

This is the project repository for final year students, **_Kishan Narotam_** and **_Nitesh Nana_**.

The project is research based and looks into finding a potential new method of image compression that can perform in noisy environments.
The premise of the project looked at creating holes in an image and transmitting the image through a simulated noisy channel and ultimately filling these holes in an appropriate manner.
